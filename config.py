"""
Example configuration for PyAutoMMDVRRender
This example config will do the following:
- Render the output 500 frames at a time using the AVI Raw codec
- Immediately convert the rendered splits to .mp4
- Automatically put the splits together when they're all rendered
- Automatically stack eyes horizontally
The final output consists of 5 .mp4 files, each corresponding to a rotation
of the camera by 90Â°.
Additionally, this config assumes that you're using the viwepoint bone model.

The comments explain what each value does and how to edit it.
Once you've read them, feel free to edit this config according to your preferences.
